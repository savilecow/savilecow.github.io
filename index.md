I am a passionate, enthusiastic product/UX designer with programming skills and academic background who enjoys working in a challenging environment.

I make sure to keep up to date with the latest technology and best practices to create the best possible experience for users.

I am comfortable both leading and working in a multidisciplinary and international team, listening and learning from my colleagues. I constantly strive to improve my skills and share what I have learned with others, and best of all have fun! 😛
